CODE MADE FOR THIS PROJECT IS A HUGE OVERKILL
Everything can be done in very simplier way but then i would've learn that much about hooks

REDUX VS HOOKS
in my opinion, for low-frequency updates like locale, theme changes, user authentication, etc. the React Context is perfectly fine. But with a more complex state which has high-frequency updates, the React Context won't be a good solution. Because, the React Context will trigger a re-render on each update, and optimizing it manually can be really tough. And there, a solution like Redux is much easier to implement.

REACT DEVS about future of hooks
We intend for Hooks to cover all existing use cases for classes, but we will keep supporting class components for the foreseeable future.
